# Pitupi-chat
Just a simple chat application in go using peer to peer networks

## Motivation
I have been studying networking recently using the book, Networking with Go and wrote summaries using obsidian and I found a really cool app, Syncthing for syncronizing your notes between your desktop and mobile obsidian apps.
It is open source and I figured it was using an hybrid form of peer to peer networks and it inspired me to learn more about the concept which eventually led to this app.
